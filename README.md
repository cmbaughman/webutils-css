# webutils-css

Shared CSS for some projects.

## Install

Clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
```

To build use:
```
npm run build
```

To just use the reset, put this in your HTML:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cmbaughman/webutils-css@main/style.min.css">
```

## Misc

I'll add more stuff here soon. Right now I just wanted a fast way to freely host this modern-reset.css on jsDelivr CDN.

The Github action in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will clear the jsDelivr cache when this repo is updated.

Modern CSS Reset is by Rahul Kaklotar (https://medium.com/@kaklotarrahul79) and inspired by Josh Comeau, Andy Bell.
